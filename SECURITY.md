# Security Policy

## Supported versions and our workflow

The `main` branch is our stable production branch, which is generally
recommended to use. Severe vulnerabilities bypass the normal workflow with
the `dev` branch and are patched directly into `main` via a hotfix.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you discovered a severe security vulnerability, which is too sensitive to
report it publicly in a GitHub issue, please report it via email to
**[`alexcoder04@protonmail.com`](mailto:alexcoder04@protonmail.com?subject=if-schleife-bot_security_vulnerability)**.

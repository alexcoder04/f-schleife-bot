# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The `main` branch is our stable production branch, which is generally
recommended to use. Severe vulnerabilities skip the normal workflow via the
`dev` branch and are patched directly into `main` via a hotfix.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you discovered a severe security vulnerability, which is too sensitive to
report it publicly in a GitHub issue, please report it via email to
**`alexcoder04@protonmail.com`**.
